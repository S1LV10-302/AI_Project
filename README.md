## Description
The scope of this project is to build an AI home assistant.
Later I plan to install it on a Raspberry PI.
The following project is implemented with the libraries:

> geocoder
> 
> speech_recognition
> 
> pyttsx3
> 
> requests

## How does it function?
### **In short, the program functions like this:**

I implemented the speech to text(and vice versa) functionality. Then I give Carla(the AI assistant) commands like "weather", "calculate", "search", "stop" and it reurns the data based on the given commands. 

To make it feel a little more natural I also added the option to say "good morning" and it returns the local weather conditions.
I plan to make it chat with you, basic topics like "how are you?".

### **Detailed functionality of given commands:**
First, you have to know that you can say "Hey Carla" and it will respond you : "Hey, how can I help you?" then you can say your command. Alternatively, you can give the command straight away.

1) **weather**

The weather functions works based on an API from [WeatherApi](https://www.weatherapi.com/).
