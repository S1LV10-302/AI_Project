# AI_Project
----WELCOME TO MY AI PROJECT JOURNEY----

The scope of this project is to build an AI home assistant. Later I plan to install it on a Raspberry PI.

The following project is implemented with the libraries:

-geocoder
-speech_recognition
-pyttsx3
-requests
-wikipedia

The project itself functions like this:
I implemented the speech to text(and vice versa) functionality. Then I give Clara(the AI assistant) commands like "weather", "calculate", "search", "stop". 
To make it feel a little more natural I also added the option to say "good morning" and it returns the local weather conditions.
I plan to make it chat with you, basic topics like "how are you?".
