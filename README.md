# AI_Project
----WELCOME TO MY AI PROJECT JOURNEY----

The scope of this project is to build an AI home assistant.
Later I plan to install it on a Raspberry PI.
The following project is implemented with the libraries:

1) geocoder
2) speech_recognition
3) pyttsx3
4) requests
5) wikipedia

The project itself functions like this:

I implemented the speech to text(and vice versa) functionality. Then I give Clara(the AI assistant) commands like "weather", "calculate", "search", "stop" and it reurns the data based on the given commands. 

To make it feel a little more natural I also added the option to say "good morning" and it returns the local weather conditions.
I plan to make it chat with you, basic topics like "how are you?".
